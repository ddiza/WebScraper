# Build a Web Scraper

## Overview
This is to build a Web Scraper in a super simple process using Node.js.

Web scraping refers to the extraction of data from a website quickly and accurately. Many people move onto selling their web scraping tools for money, either by building them as a chrome extension or API, or selling them to data capturing companies. Others leverage this tool as part of their main website and associate with affiliate marketing.

For this task we will web scrape article titles and assigned URLs listed in The Guardian online media website.
